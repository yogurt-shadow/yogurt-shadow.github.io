abstract = {Local search has recently been applied to SMT problems over various arithmetic theories. Among these, nonlinear real arithmetic poses special challenges due to its uncountable solution space and potential need to solve higher-degree polynomials. As a consequence, existing work on local search only considered fragments of the theory. In this work, we analyze the difficulties and propose ways to address them, resulting in an efficient search algorithm that covers the full theory of nonlinear real arithmetic. In particular, we present two algorithmic improvements: incremental computation of variable scores and temporary relaxation of equality constraints. We also discuss choice of candidate moves and a look-ahead mechanism in case when no critical moves are available. The resulting implementation is competitive on satisfiable problem instances against complete methods such as MCSAT in existing SMT solvers.},

abstract = {This thesis presents a novel, level-wise approach to single cell construction in Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). It can be used in Satisﬁability Modulo Theories solvers for Quantiﬁer Free Non-Linear Real Arithmetic like for example nlsat [JdM12]. For one such solver, testing shows that the usage of the level-wise approach over a recursive approach [BK15] decreases the mean solving time by 10.38%. Given a set of multivariate polynomials with rational coeﬃcients and a point, a single cell construction algorithm returns a cylindrical algebraic cell around the point. In general, this cell is a superset of the cell that would be constructed as a part of a CAD. The idea of the level-wise approach is to construct the cell top to bottom. This means initializing the cell as R i for the appropriate i and then determining the correct bounds one component after the other, starting in the i -th dimension down to the ﬁrst. Brown-McCallum’s projection operator [Bro01][BK15] which is a reduction of McCallum’s projection operator [McC98] is used in the process.},

Despite great interest from other communities, the difficulty to implement novel techniques from computer algebra proves to be a significant hindrance, especially, when a modern computer algebra system cannot be used. We tackle cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) as one such example. CAD can be, for example, applied in satisfiability modulo theories solving for nonlinear real arithmetic. However, a recent advance in CAD, the Lazard's lifting scheme, requires additional algebraic techniques that are neither available in these solvers, nor as stand-alone libraries. We close this gap by showing how to use the CoCoALib library to implement Lazard's lifting scheme outside of a modern computer algebra system like Maple.},

abstract = {Model-constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework has been applied to SMT problems on different arithmetic theories. NLSAT, an implementation using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for explanation, is especially competitive among nonlinear real arithmetic constraints. However, current Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style algorithms only consider literal information for decision, and thus ignore clause-level influence on arithmetic variables. As a consequence, NLSAT encounters unnecessary conflicts caused by improper literal decisions. In this work, we analyze the literal decision caused conflicts, and introduce clause-level information with a direct effect on arithmetic variables. Two main algorithm improvements are presented: clause-level feasible-set based look-ahead mechanism and arithmetic propagation based branching heuristic. We implement our solver named clauseSMT on our dynamic variable ordering framework. Experiments show that clauseSMT is competitive on nonlinear real arithmetic theory against existing SMT solvers (cvc5, Z3, Yices2), and outperforms all these solvers on satisfiable instances of SMT(QF_NRA) in SMT-LIB.

abstract = {Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic, SMT(NRA) for short, concerns the satisfiability of polynomial formulas, which are quantifier-free Boolean combinations of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients and real variables. In this paper, we propose a local search algorithm for a special subclass of SMT(NRA), where all constraints are strict inequalities. An important fact is that, given a polynomial formula with $n$ variables, the zero level set of the polynomials in the formula decomposes the $n$-dimensional real space into finitely many components (cells) and every polynomial has constant sign in each cell. The key point of our algorithm is a new operation based on real root isolation, called cell-jump, which updates the current assignment along a given direction such that the assignment can `jump' from one cell to another. One cell-jump may adjust the values of several variables while traditional local search operations, such as flip for SAT and critical move for SMT(LIA), only change that of one variable. We also design a two-level operation selection to balance the success rate and efficiency. Furthermore, our algorithm can be easily generalized to a wider subclass of SMT(NRA) where polynomial equations linear with respect to some variable are allowed. Experiments show the algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulas with high-degree polynomials.},

abstract = {The satisfiability problem is the problem of deciding whether a logical formula is satisfiable. For first-order arithmetic theories, in the early 20th century some novel solutions in form of decision procedures were developed in the area of mathematical logic. With the advent of powerful computer architectures, a new research line started to develop practically feasible implementations of such decision procedures. Since then, symbolic computation has grown to an extremely successful scientific area, supporting all kinds of scientific computing by efficient computer algebra systems. Independently, around 1960 a new technology called SAT solving started its career. Restricted to propositional logic, SAT solvers showed to be very efficient when employed by formal methods for verification. It did not take long till the power of SAT solving for Boolean problems had been extended to cover also different theories. Nowadays, fast SAT-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers are available also for arithmetic problems. Due to their different roots, symbolic computation and SMT solving tackle the satisfiability problem differently. We discuss differences and similarities in their approaches, highlight potentials of combining their strengths, and discuss the challenges that come with this task.},

In this article, we focus on Satisfiablity Modulo Integer Arithmetic, which is referred to as SMT(IA), including both linear and non-linear integer arithmetic theories. Dominant approaches to SMT rely on calling a CDCL-based SAT solver, either in a lazy or eager flavour. Local search, a competitive approach to solving combinatorial problems including SAT, however, has not been well studied for SMT. We develop the first local-search algorithm for SMT(IA) by directly operating on variables, breaking through the traditional framework. We propose a local-search framework by considering the distinctions between Boolean and integer variables. Moreover, we design a novel operator and scoring functions tailored for integer arithmetic, as well as a two-level operation selection heuristic. Putting these together, we develop a local search SMT(IA) solver called LocalSMT. Experiments are carried out to evaluate LocalSMT on benchmark sets from SMT-LIB. The results show that LocalSMT is competitive and complementary with state-of-the-art SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulae with only integer variables. A simple sequential portfolio with Z3 improves the state-of-the-art on satisfiable benchmark sets from SMT-LIB.},

abstract = {The model constructing satis ability calculus (MCSAT) is an abstract decision procedure for determining the satis ability of rst-order logic formulas with respect to some theory. This process is known as satis ability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In particular, MCSAT can be applied to the theory of quanti er free non-linear real arithmetic (QFNRA), whose formulas are Boolean combinations of polynomial constraints. A crucial step of the algorithm is the construction of a single cell around a given point in the multidimensional real space so that a given set of polynomials is sign-invariant on that cell. In this thesis, we modify a recently proposed method for single cell construction, showing how arti cial low-degree polynomials can be introduced during the construction to speed up the computation of resultants, with the drawback of underapproximating the cell. Experimental results suggest that our approach can outperform the original method in the context of MCSAT.},

abstract = {Satisfiability modulo theories solving is a technology to solve logically encoded problems for many applications like verification, testing, or planning. Among the many theories that are considered within this logical framework, nonlinear real arithmetic stands out as particularly challenging, yet decidable and sufficiently well understood from a mathematical perspective. The most prominent approach that can decide upon nonlinear real questions in a complete way is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition method. We explore the usage of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition method for satisfiability modulo theories solving, both theoretically and experimentally. This method is commonly understood as an almost atomic procedure that gathers information about an algebraic problem and then allows to answer all kinds of questions about this algebraic problem afterward. We essentially break up this method into smaller components that we can then process in varying order to derive the particular piece of information – whether the problem is satisfiable or unsatisfiable – allowing to avoid some amount of computations. As this method often exhibits doubly exponential running time, these savings can be very significant in practice. We furthermore embed this method in the regular satisfiability modulo theories framework where the cylindrical algebraic method is faced with a sequence of problems that are “related” in the sense that they usually share large parts of their problem statements. We devise different approaches to retain information from a previous run so that it can be reused when the problem is only “extended” as well as purging now obsolete information if the problem is “reduced”. These variants change in how much information can be reused, the granularity of the information that is removed, and how much bookkeeping needs to be done. This integration is then enhanced with techniques that are more or less well-known in the computer algebra community, for example, different projection operators, equational constraints, or employing the so-called resultant rule. Furthermore, we present novel features necessary for an efficient embedding in the satisfiability modulo theories framework like infeasible subset computations and early termination as well as extensions to integer problems and optimization problems. We then turn to an alternative approach to satisfiability modulo theories solving that is commonly called model-constructing satisfiability calculus. The core idea of this framework is to integrate the theory reasoning, in particular the construction of a theory model, tightly with the Boolean reasoning. The most popular theory reasoning engine is again based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition method, though we focus on the overall framework here. We start with our own variant of the model-constructing satisfiability calculus and discuss some general insights and changes compared to current implementations. We then proceed to present a whole series of reasoning engines for arithmetic problems and show how a proper (though still naive) combination of those serves to significantly improve a practical solver. We also show how the tight integration into the Boolean reasoning allows for novel strategies for notoriously hard problems like the theory variable ordering or expedient cooperation between the Boolean and the theory reasoning. Finally, we consider the theoretical relation of the model-constructing satisfiability calculus to other proof systems, in particular, the aforementioned regular satisfiability modulo theories solving. Under certain assumptions – that turn out to be instructive in and of themselves – we show that they are equivalent with respect to their proof complexity and even establish what we call “algorithmic equivalency” afterward.},

abstract = {Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a first-order formula with respect to some theory or combination of theories; Verification Modulo Theories (VMT) is the problem of analyzing the reachability for transition systems represented in terms of SMT formulae. In this article, we tackle the problems of SMT and VMT over the theories of nonlinear arithmetic over the reals (NRA) and of NRA augmented with transcendental (exponential and trigonometric) functions (NTA). We propose a new abstraction-refinement approach for SMT and VMT on NRA or NTA, called Incremental Linearization. The idea is to abstract nonlinear multiplication and transcendental functions as uninterpreted functions in an abstract space limited to linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions. The uninterpreted functions are incrementally axiomatized by means of upper- and lower-bounding piecewise-linear constraints. In the case of transcendental functions, particular care is required to ensure the soundness of the abstraction. The method has been implemented in the MathSAT SMT solver and in the nuXmv model checker. An extensive experimental evaluation on a wide set of benchmarks from verification and mathematics demonstrates the generality and the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) plays an important role in the field of real algebraic geometry and many other areas. As is well-known, the choice of variable ordering while computing CAD has a great effect on the time and memory use of the computation as well as the number of sample points computed. In this paper, we indicate that typical CAD algorithms, if executed with respect to a special kind of variable orderings (called "the perfect elimination orderings''), naturally preserve chordality, which is well compatible with an important (variable) sparsity pattern called "the correlative sparsity''. Experimentation suggests that if the associated graph of the polynomial system in question is chordal (resp., is nearly chordal), then a perfect elimination ordering of the associated graph (resp., of a minimal chordal completion of the associated graph) can be a good variable ordering for the CAD computation. That is, by using the perfect elimination orderings, the CAD computation may produce a much smaller full set of projection polynomials than by using other naive variable orderings. More importantly, for the complexity analysis of the CAD computation via a perfect elimination ordering, an (m,d)-property of the full set of projection polynomials obtained via such an ordering is given, through which the "size'' of this set is characterized. This property indicates that when the corresponding perfect elimination tree has a lower height, the full set of projection polynomials also tends to have a smaller "size''. This is well consistent with the experimental results, hence the perfect elimination orderings with lower elimination tree height are further recommended to be used in the CAD projection.},

Such choices are candidates for machine learning (ML) approaches, however, there are difficulties in applying standard ML techniques, such as the efficient identification of ML features from input data which is typically a polynomial system. Our focus is selecting the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), an important algorithm implemented in several CASs, and now also SMT-solvers. We created a framework to describe all the previously identified ML features for the problem and then enumerated all options in this framework to automatically generation many more features. We validate the usefulness of these with an experiment which shows that an ML choice for CAD variable ordering is superior to those made by human created heuristics, and further improved with these additional features. We expect that this technique of feature generation could be useful for other choices related to CAD, or even choices for other algorithms with polynomial systems for input.},
